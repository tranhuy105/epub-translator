5. **Switching themes:**
    - Toggle the theme using the "Theme" button to switch between light and dark modes.

## API Client Implementation

The application supports different translation APIs. But if you want to implement your own API client, you can do it easily by following these steps:

1. **Create a new API client class:**
    - Implement the `ApiClient` interface.

    ```java
    package com.tranhuy105.epubtranslator.services;

    import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
    import java.net.MalformedURLException;
    import java.net.URL;
    import java.io.IOException;

    public class MyCustomApiClient implements ApiClient {
        @Override
        public HttpURLConnection getHttpURLConnection(String originalText, URL url, String source, String target) throws IOException {
            // Your connection logic here
            return null; // Replace with actual connection logic
        }

        @Override
        public URL buildUrl(String originalText, String source, String target) throws MalformedURLException {
            // Your URL building logic here
            return null; // Replace with actual URL building logic
        }

        @Override
        public String parseResponse(String content) {
            // You need to extract the translated text from the response here
            return null; // Replace with actual response parsing logic
        }
    }
    ```

1. **Register your API client:**
    - Add your API client to the `ApiClientType` enum.

    ```java
    public enum ApiClientType {
        MY_MEMORY,
        MICROSOFT_TRANSLATOR,
        DEEPL_TRANSLATOR,
        MY_CUSTOM_API; // Add your custom API client here
    }
    ```

    - Register your client to the api client factory at `ApiClientService`.

    ```java
    public class ApiClientService() {
        public static ApiClient getClient(ApiClientType type) {
            return switch (type) {
                case MY_MEMORY -> new MyMemoryApiClient();
                case DEEP_TRANSLATE -> getDeepTranslatorApiClient();
                case MICROSOFT_TRANSLATOR -> getMicrosoftTranslatorClient();
                case MY_CUSTOM_API -> getMyCustomApi(); 
            };
        }
   
        public ApiClient getMyCustomApi() {
            // Implement your method here
            return null;
        }
        
        // other method
   }
    ```
